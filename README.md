# P-MimicGraphRAG: Personalized Mimicking Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for a Personal Robot

Welcome to the P-MimicGraphRAG project! This repository contains the implementation of a novel framework extending GraphRAG to create a personal robot that mimics an individual’s biology, research, and behavior. Using chunking, knowledge graphs stored in Neo4j, vector databases, and self-evolving mechanisms, P-MimicGraphRAG delivers accurate, personalized responses and adapts dynamically to real-time data, transforming personal AI into a trusted, adaptive companion.

## Overview

P-MimicGraphRAG is a cutting-edge AI system designed to build a personal robot that learns and mimics your unique profile, including your biological data, research activities, and behavioral patterns. It leverages:

- **GraphRAG**: A graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework for structured knowledge management.
- **Chunking and Summarization**: Segments personal data into chunks, summarizes them into vectors, and stores them in a vector database for efficient retrieval.
- **Neo4j**: A graph database to store and manage knowledge graphs with node types and edge relationships.
- **Self-Evolving Mechanism**: Uses large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically adapt the system to new data (e.g., research updates, biometric logs).

The system generates hypothetical questions from chunks to enable proactive, personalized responses, mimicking your style and decision-making.

## Features
- **Personalization**: Tailors responses and behavior to your biology, research, and behavior.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Continuously evolves knowledge graphs with real-time data updates.
- **Proactive Retrieval**: Generates and matches hypothetical questions to anticipate your needs.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Ensures data privacy through anonymization and GDPR-compliant practices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Neo4j (Community Edition or Enterprise, version 4.4+)
- A vector database (e.g., Faiss, Pinecone)
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `torch`, `transformers`, `spacy`, `neo4j`, `faiss-cpu` (or `faiss-gpu`)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/p-mimicgraphrag.git
   cd p-mimicgraphrag
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Neo4j:
   - Install Neo4j locally or use a cloud instance.
   - Configure the Neo4j connection in `config.py` with your database URI, username, and password.

4. Set up the vector database (e.g., Faiss):
   - Install Faiss: `pip install faiss-cpu` (or `faiss-gpu` for GPU support).
   - Initialize the vector database in `vector_db.py`.

5. Obtain an LLM (e.g., LLaMA-3) and fine-tune it on your personal data (instructions in `llm_setup.md`).

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. Prepare your personal data (e.g., research papers, biometric logs, behavioral records) in text format and place them in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the chunking and summarization pipeline:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py --input data/personal_data.txt --output chunks/
   ```
3. Build and store the knowledge graph in Neo4j:
   ```bash
   python build_graph.py --chunks chunks/ --neo4j-uri your-neo4j-uri --neo4j-user your-username --neo4j-password your-password
   ```
4. Generate hypothetical questions and store vectors:
   ```bash
   python generate_hypotheses.py --chunks chunks/ --vector-db output/vectors
   ```
5. Query the robot for personalized responses:
   ```bash
   python query_robot.py --question "What’s my latest research focus?" --vector-db output/vectors --neo4j-uri your-neo4j-uri
   ```

### Example Output
For a query like “What’s my latest research focus?”, the robot might respond: “Based on your recent updates, your focus is on advancing graph-based AI for personalized systems.”

## Technical Details

- **Chunking and Summarization**: Uses NLP tools (e.g., spaCy, BERT) to segment data into chunks, summarizes them with an LLM, and encodes summaries into a vector database (e.g., Faiss) for semantic matching.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Constructs graphs in Neo4j with node types (e.g., Person, Technology, BiologicalMetric) and edge relationships (e.g., “researches,” “affects,” “observes”) using GraphRAG’s triple-based approach.
- **Self-Evolving Mechanism**: Employs GNNs (e.g., GraphSAGE) for edge prediction and RL (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO) for graph optimization, adapting to real-time data (e.g., new research, wearable logs).
- **Retrieval and Response**: Uses GraphRAG’s U-Retrieval to query Neo4j, matches questions to chunk hypotheses in the vector database, and generates responses with an LLM (e.g., fine-tuned LLaMA-3).
